# Customer Churn Prediction System
## üìå Overview
This project is an interactive Churn Prediction System platform, developed using Python, Django framework and Machine Learning algorithms(Logistic Regression, XGBoost). This app enables businesses in driving strategic retention strategies and improving customer experience.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Project Highlights:
- Utilized Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost) to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
- Designed a fully interactive web application using Django, enabling seamless data input and real-time predictions.
- Engineered features like customer satisfaction scores, contract types, and internet service preferences to identify key churn drivers.
- Employed ensemble modeling to enhance prediction reliability, averaging probabilities from both models for optimal results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Setup:

1. Download and Extract the Project:
    - Download the `.zip` file.
    - Extract the contents of the zip file to a desired location on your computer.

2. Create virtual environment:
    - Navigate to the project directory using: "cd path_to_the_project/churn_prediction"
    - Run the following command to create virtual environment: "python -m venv churn_prediction_venv"

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    Windows:
    ```bash
    cd path\to\ProjectCodeFiles\churn_prediction_venv\Scripts
    activate
    ```

    Mac/Linux:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/ProjectCodeFiles/churn_prediction_venv/bin
    source activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies via - "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the created virtual environment.
   Note: Manual installation of dependencies might be required if the virtual environment is not compatible with the terminal configurations and the current Python version.

5. Run the Django Development Server:
    - Navigate to the `churn_prediction` directory:
      ```bash
      cd path\to\churn_prediction
      ```
    - Run the Django development server:
      ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
6. Access the Application:-
   - Open your web browser 
   - Go to link provided in terminal to access the web app.

## üìí Notes

- No additional software is required: The project is configured such that all necessary libraries are bundled within the project directories, so there's no need to install them separately or modify environment variables.
- Running the Application: Ensure the virtual environment is activated each time before running the application.
